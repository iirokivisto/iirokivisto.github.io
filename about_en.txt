I’m a Finnish artist and designer living in Rauma on Finland’s west coast. I work as a 3D artist in the film visual effects industry.

In my 3D work, I often discover techniques that lead to unconventional and visually compelling designs. Some of these ideas are directly applicable to film VFX, while others are strong enough to exist on their own in physical form. My personal work explores these possibilities, translating digital concepts into tangible objects.

I have a strong passion for handcrafts. Spending much of my professional life in front of a screen has led me to balance digital work with traditional mediums such as painting and woodworking. Living close to nature, I always have access to natural materials. Their character, particularly in wood, often guides the work, allowing the raw qualities of the material to shape the final piece.
