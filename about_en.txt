Welcome to my portfolio site. Here you can see a selection of my latest artworks. I create art both on commission and from my own inspiration.
</p>

<p>
I produce a wide variety of commissioned work, often abstract paintings or figurative ink drawings, but also wood sculptures and other carpentry-related artworks. For example, I always build the frames for my paintings myself.

<p>
Abstract paintings suit many different spaces and can be created on canvas or acoustic panels, making them functional as well as decorative.

<p>
I can also create commissioned ink drawings based on a requested theme. When properly framed, they fit a wide range of interiors.
