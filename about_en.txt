IINO Design is a design studio from Rauma, Finland, with a strong focus on nature and traditional craftsmanship. All products are carefully crafted in small batches using local materials.

Production begins with carefully selecting and preparing the wood—mainly slowly grown birch and oak from the Pyhämaa archipelago. The wood is dried and treated gently to retain its shape and durability for generations.

All products are designed and crafted in Rauma, Finland. The design studio's modern production process combines 3D modeling, CNC milling, and traditional woodworking. Each piece is hand-finished to ensure the final product feels as authentic and natural as possible.

The company is guided by the principle of sustainable and local production. IINO Design strives to preserve the tradition of woodworking while highlighting the significance of the wood’s origin in Finnish design.
