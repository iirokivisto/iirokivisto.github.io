<p>
Welcome to my portfolio. Here you can see a selection of my latest works. Some were created on commission, while others are driven by my own ideas and artistic exploration.
</p>

<p>
I produce a wide range of commissioned work, including abstract paintings, figurative ink drawings, sculptures, and carpentry-based pieces such as design furniture. I also build the frames for my paintings myself.
</p>

<p>
Abstract paintings suit a variety of spaces and can be created on canvas or acoustic panels, making them both functional and decorative.
</p>

<p>
I also create commissioned ink drawings based on a requested theme — for example, a pet or a loved one. When properly framed, they complement a wide range of interiors.
